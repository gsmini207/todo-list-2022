## Momentum Clone 'todo-list'


- I used HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.
- After implementing the basic JS files, I designed the final product using HTML and CSS.
- I used local storage to save login information and reflect it on the todo list page.
- I implemented the delete feature using filters to find and delete items with the same ID.
- I used an open API and implemented fetch to identify the user's current location and display weather information accordingly.
